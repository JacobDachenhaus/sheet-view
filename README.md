# This repo has been archived.

This is an old project of mine and has not been maintained for a while. Please check out my newer projects [here](https://github.com/JacobDachenhaus).  
Thanks for visiting! ❤️

Reasons for archival:
- Really old project
- Not being actively maintained
- Last push was over a year ago
- Lots of bugs/issues that aren't worth fixing

The app functions as a basic sheet reader, although I don't believe the search function is working correctly.
